# OL Portal — Running Costs at 10 / 25 / 100 / 500 Users

Last updated: July 21, 2026. All prices USD, monthly unless noted. Grounded in what is
actually deployed: AWS stack `ol-portal-backend` (us-east-1, account 371361645693),
the Claude API (Sonnet 5 for The Optimist, Haiku 4.5 for the file analyzer — switched
from all-Opus on July 21, 2026), and the QuickBooks Online integration in
`backend/src/qbo.mjs`.

The one-line summary: **the Claude API is ~90% of the cost at every tier.** AWS
infrastructure is nearly free until ~100 users, and the Intuit API charges nothing
per call.

---

## 1. Cost per AI action (the unit economics)

The two AI features run on different models, matched to what each needs:

| Feature | Model | Input / Output per MTok |
|---|---|---|
| The Optimist (proposal writing) | `claude-sonnet-5` | $3 / $15 — **intro pricing $2 / $10 through Aug 31, 2026** |
| File analyzer (classify + summarize) | `claude-haiku-4-5` | $1 / $5 |

The Optimist uses adaptive thinking; thinking tokens bill as output tokens.
Numbers below use Sonnet 5's standard ($3/$15) pricing — knock ~33% off the
Optimist lines through August 2026 while intro pricing lasts.

### The Optimist (`POST /assist`, `assist.mjs`)

Every chat message sends: system prompt (~800 tokens) + the full knowledge base
(each KB entry up to 30k chars) + deal context + the current draft of all 6 sections
+ up to the last 30 conversation turns. `max_tokens: 6000`.

| Per Optimist message (Sonnet 5, standard pricing) | Tokens (typical) | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Input (system + KB + draft + history) | 6,000–15,000 | $0.018–$0.045 |
| Output (reply + section JSON + thinking) | 1,500–4,000 | $0.023–$0.06 |
| **Total per message** | | **~$0.04–$0.10 (avg ~$0.06; ~$0.04 on intro pricing)** |

- Input grows as the conversation and draft grow — later messages in a long
  proposal chat cost more than early ones.
- **A full proposal** built through ~15 Optimist messages: **~$0.90** (range
  $0.60–$1.80 depending on chat length and draft size).
- **Attachments** add one-time input cost on that message: a PDF bills roughly
  1,500–3,000 tokens/page, so a 20-page attached document adds ~$0.12–$0.18.
  Text files are capped at 150k chars (~$0.12 max). "⚡ Auto-fill the rest" is a
  normal message with a large output (~full 6 sections) — budget ~$0.10.

### File analyzer (`ol-portal-analyzer`, S3-triggered)

One Claude call per uploaded file ≤10MB (larger files are stored without analysis).
`max_tokens: 8192`, runs on Haiku 4.5.

| Per file analyzed (Haiku 4.5) | Tokens (typical) | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Input (document content) | 5,000–40,000 (5–25 page doc) | $0.005–$0.04 |
| Output (docType/summary/keyPoints) | 800–2,000 | $0.004–$0.01 |
| **Total per file** | | **~$0.01–$0.05 (avg ~$0.03); dense 100+ page PDFs up to ~$0.20** |

---

## 2. Usage assumptions per tier

Internal users split across Admin / Lab Leader / Contributor. Contributors
(bench-only) generate almost no AI usage; Admins and Lab Leaders drive it.
Assumed monthly averages **per user** (blended across roles):

| Assumption | Value |
|---|---|
| Optimist messages | 30 per user (≈ 2 proposals × 15 messages) |
| File uploads analyzed | 5 per user |
| API requests (page loads, saves, bootstrap) | ~2,000 per user |
| Blended AI cost per user | **~$1.95/mo** (heavy Lab Leaders can be $5–8; Contributors near $0) |

If real usage skews heavier (more proposals per Lab Leader, big attachments),
scale the Claude line linearly — it is almost exactly $0.10 per Optimist message
and $0.15 per file.

## 3. Monthly cost by tier

### Claude API (billed by Anthropic, not AWS — key lives in SSM `/ol-portal/anthropic-api-key`)

| | 10 users | 25 users | 100 users | 500 users |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Optimist on Sonnet 5 (30 msgs/user × ~$0.06) | $18 | $45 | $180 | $900 |
| File analysis on Haiku (5 files/user × ~$0.03) | $1.50 | $4 | $15 | $75 |
| **Claude total** | **~$20** | **~$49** | **~$195** | **~$975** |
| While Sonnet 5 intro pricing lasts (through Aug 2026) | ~$14 | ~$34 | ~$135 | ~$675 |
| Range (light ↔ heavy usage) | $10–$40 | $25–$100 | $100–$400 | $500–$2,000 |

### AWS infrastructure (account 371361645693)

| Service | 10 users | 25 users | 100 users | 500 users | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Lambda (`ol-portal-api`, 2048MB, holds 10–30s per assist call) | $0.20 | $0.50 | $2 | $8 | The assist route dominates: ~40 GB-s × $0.0000133 ≈ $0.0005/call. Everything else is <150ms. Mostly inside the 400k GB-s free tier at small tiers |
| Lambda (analyzer 512MB, auth-events, recurring cron) | <$0.10 | <$0.25 | $1 | $4 | |
| API Gateway (HTTP API, $1/M requests) | $0.02 | $0.05 | $0.20 | $1 | |
| DynamoDB (`ol-portal`, on-demand + PITR) | $0.25 | $0.50 | $2 | $8 | Bootstrap reads whole table per session; still tiny |
| S3 (`ol-portal-files-…`, 50MB/file cap) | $0.05 | $0.15 | $1 | $5 | ~5 files × 5MB/user stored, plus requests |
| Cognito (Essentials tier) | $0 | $0 | $0 | $0 | First 10,000 MAU free — all tiers fit |
| Amplify Hosting (builds + data out) | $0.50 | $0.75 | $2 | $6 | Small static frontend; builds $0.01/min |
| CloudWatch Logs | $0.25 | $0.50 | $2 | $8 | Assist/analyzer logs grow with AI usage |
| SSM Parameter Store (standard) | $0 | $0 | $0 | $0 | |
| **AWS total** | **~$1.50** | **~$3** | **~$10** | **~$40** | |

> ⚠️ The **$10/mo AWS budget alert** on the OL account will start tripping around
> the 100-user tier. Raise it before scaling past ~75 users so it stays a real
> anomaly signal (suggested: 2× the expected AWS spend for the current tier).

### Intuit / QuickBooks API

The QBO integration makes these calls (`qbo.mjs`):

| Call | Endpoint | When | Per-call cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| OAuth authorize redirect | `appcenter.intuit.com/connect/oauth2` | Once, when an admin connects | $0 |
| Token exchange | `oauth.platform.intuit.com/oauth2/v1/tokens/bearer` | Once at connect | $0 |
| Token refresh | same bearer endpoint | Access tokens last 1 hour; refreshed on demand before reads | $0 |
| Invoice read | `GET /v3/company/{realmId}/query` — `SELECT * FROM Invoice MAXRESULTS 100` | Each time an admin opens the QuickBooks card on invoices.html | $0 |
| Status check | (local token lookup, no Intuit call) | Page load | $0 |

**The QuickBooks Online Accounting API has no per-call pricing.** Costs are:

| Item | Cost | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Intuit developer account + sandbox | $0 | Current `QBO_ENV=sandbox` costs nothing |
| API calls (production) | $0 | Free with a QBO company subscription; rate limit 500 requests/min per realm — the portal's admin-only reads use a tiny fraction even at 500 users |
| QuickBooks Online subscription (production prerequisite) | ~$38–$99/mo depending on plan (verify current Intuit pricing) | Whoever owns the connected books (OL) pays this regardless of the portal; it is not a per-user portal cost |

QBO cost is **flat across all four tiers** — only admins hit `/qbo/*`, and there is
one connected realm. The only action item for production is the redirect-URI
registration + prod client secret (already documented in the repo); no cost impact.

## 4. Total monthly cost summary

| | 10 users | 25 users | 100 users | 500 users |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Claude API (Anthropic invoice) | $20 | $49 | $195 | $975 |
| AWS (OL account) | $1.50 | $3 | $10 | $40 |
| Intuit API | $0 | $0 | $0 | $0 |
| **Total** | **~$21** | **~$52** | **~$205** | **~$1,015** |
| **Per user** | ~$2.15 | ~$2.10 | ~$2.05 | ~$2.03 |

Cost scales almost perfectly linearly with users because it is dominated by
per-message Claude spend. There is no meaningful fixed-cost floor beyond ~$1/mo.

---

## 5. Model choice — how swapping Claude models changes cost

Every current Claude model keeps the same 1:5 input/output price ratio, so model
choice scales each feature's cost by a simple multiplier:

| Model | Input / Output per MTok | vs Opus 4.8 | Optimist msg | File analyzed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Fable 5 (`claude-fable-5`) | $10 / $50 | 2.0× | ~$0.20 | ~$0.30 |
| Claude Opus 4.8 (`claude-opus-4-8`) | $5 / $25 | 1.0× | ~$0.10 | ~$0.15 |
| **Claude Sonnet 5 (`claude-sonnet-5`) — current Optimist model** | $3 / $15 | 0.6× | ~$0.06 | ~$0.09 |
| Claude Sonnet 5 — intro pricing through Aug 31, 2026 | $2 / $10 | 0.4× | ~$0.04 | ~$0.06 |
| **Claude Haiku 4.5 (`claude-haiku-4-5`) — current analyzer model** | $1 / $5 | 0.2× | ~$0.02 | ~$0.03 |

### Monthly Claude spend by scenario

| Scenario | 10 users | 25 users | 100 users | 500 users |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Everything on Opus 4.8 (config before July 21, 2026) | $38 | $94 | $375 | $1,875 |
| Analyzer → Haiku, Optimist on Opus | $32 | $79 | $315 | $1,575 |
| **Current: Optimist → Sonnet 5, analyzer → Haiku** | **$20** | **$49** | **$195** | **$975** |
| Everything → Sonnet 5 | $23 | $56 | $225 | $1,125 |
| Everything → Haiku 4.5 | $8 | $19 | $75 | $375 |
| Everything → Fable 5 | $75 | $188 | $750 | $3,750 |

### Why this configuration

- **Analyzer on Haiku 4.5:** classification + summary + key-point extraction is
  well within Haiku's range — 80% cheaper than Opus with minimal quality risk.
  (Haiku's 200K context window is still far more than any ≤10MB doc the
  analyzer accepts. Haiku doesn't support adaptive thinking, so the analyzer
  runs without a thinking parameter.)
- **Optimist on Sonnet 5:** near-Opus quality on writing and agentic work at
  0.6× the price (0.4× on intro pricing through Aug 2026). If proposal quality
  noticeably drops on real deals, switching back is a one-line change in
  `assist.mjs` (`model: "claude-opus-4-8"`) + `sam deploy` — the ~$1,500/mo
  question only matters at the 500-user tier.
- **Haiku for the Optimist is not recommended** — interview quality and section
  prose would noticeably weaken. **Fable 5** doubles Opus cost and targets
  long-horizon agentic work; overkill for both features.
- Caveat: token counts differ slightly across models (Haiku uses an older
  tokenizer), so treat the multipliers as ±10%. The structural cost —
  re-sending the KB and draft every message — dominates regardless of model,
  so the prompt-caching lever below stacks with any model choice.

## 6. Levers if Claude spend needs to come down

Ordered by impact:

1. ~~Route each feature to the right-sized model.~~ **Done July 21, 2026** —
   Optimist on Sonnet 5, analyzer on Haiku 4.5 (cut the Claude line ~48% vs
   all-Opus).
2. **Prompt caching (up to ~90% off input on repeat calls).** The assist system
   prompt embeds the live draft, so today no prefix is stable enough to cache.
   Restructuring so KB + static instructions come first with a `cache_control`
   breakpoint (draft + deal context after it) would cut the input side of every
   Optimist message substantially — cached reads bill at ~10% of the input rate.
3. **Trim what each assist call re-sends.** Only include KB entries relevant to
   the deal's lab, and drop draft sections that haven't changed, instead of
   shipping everything every message.
4. **Per-user rate limiting / monthly caps** on `/assist` before opening the
   portal to many Lab Leaders, so a runaway chat loop can't create a surprise bill.
5. **Set an Anthropic console spend limit** mirroring the AWS budget alert —
   today the Claude spend has no equivalent guardrail.
